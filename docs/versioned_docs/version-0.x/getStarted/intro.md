# Introduction

In today's increasingly digital world, the concept of identity is rapidly evolving beyond physical documents to secure digital formats. Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) represent the next generation of identity verification, bringing traditional credentials into the digital age with enhanced security and convenience.

## What are Verifiable Digital Credentials?

At their core, VDCs are digital versions of physical credentials you use every day—such as driver's licenses, passports, educational diplomas, or insurance cards—stored securely on your smartphone or digital device. What makes them "verifiable" is the cryptographic technology underlying them, which allows any receiving party to confirm their authenticity without contacting the original issuer.

## Real-World Applications

Consider a common scenario: presenting your driver's license. Traditionally, this requires carrying a physical card that could be lost, stolen, or counterfeited. With a mobile driver's license (mDL)—a type of VDC—you can securely present your identification via your smartphone, whether at airport security, when purchasing age-restricted products, or when opening a bank account online.

The key advantage lies in control and privacy. When using a VDC, you can often choose exactly which information to share. For instance, if a merchant only needs to verify your age, your VDC application can disclose just that information without revealing other personal details like your address or exact birthdate.

## Purpose of This Document

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the VDC ecosystem for organizations and individuals interested in implementing or utilizing digital credentials. Whether you're a government agency looking to issue digital IDs, a business exploring secure verification options, or a technology provider developing VDC solutions, this document will help navigate the complex landscape of digital identity verification.

We'll explore the fundamental components that make up the VDC infrastructure, the technologies and standards that enable secure credential exchange, implementation considerations, and the evolving opportunities in this rapidly growing field.

As digital identity becomes increasingly central to how we interact with services and institutions, understanding the secure, privacy-preserving potential of VDCs becomes essential for forward-thinking organizations across all sectors.
